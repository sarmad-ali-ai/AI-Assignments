# 🏥 SQL Portfolio Project – Hospital Intelligence Dashboard

#Overview
This project simulates the role of a junior healthcare data analyst, tasked with building insights for hospital management using SQL.  
The goal was to analyze patient encounters, procedures, payer coverage, costs, and readmissions to support data-driven decisions.  

#📊 Database Coverage
-Encounters 
-Patients 
-Procedures 
-Payer Coverage / Billing
-Diagnoses
-Medications  

#🔍 Key Analysis
- Total encounters per year and percentage by encounter class (inpatient, emergency, etc.)  
- Stay duration analysis (**Short Stay <24h vs Long Stay ≥24h**)  
- Top 10 most frequent procedures and their average costs  
- Costliest procedures with performance counts  
- Claim cost analysis by insurance provider  
- Unique patients per quarter  
- Readmissions within 30 days & top 5 most readmitted patients  
- First vs. latest encounter analysis  
- Advanced logic with CTE + CASE for pivot-style tables  
- Most recent encounter per patient and diagnoses by age group  

🛠️ Tools & Skills
- SQL (joins, aggregations, CTEs, CASE statements, window functions)  
- Data analysis and reporting  
- Healthcare analytics  



## 🚀 Next Steps
This project is part of my **SQL learning portfolio**. More case studies and business analysis projects will be added in future.
